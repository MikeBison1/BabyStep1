# Day 1 - Learning Git Bash
In order to make changes from Local to Cloud:

I. File must be updated in nano "nano day1.md" to open day1.md text file 
in editor II. Once changes done, CTRL+0 to Confirm Input Complete III. 
Confirm File name (could be clonining to new file)
IV. File must be staged with 'Git add day1.md" or stage all with "git add ."V. Commit changes with "git commit -m "comment about why update" VI. Then push to Git via "git push"

That will push files to web

Now for pulling from the web
Because I had some local changes in the executable, I had to run 'git 
reset -hard' to get it to clear those changes. Then in the exe I ran git 
pull, to pull down the (web based) updated Git File

Now I'm adding more info to push back to the web
