# Day 1 - Learning Git Bash
Today I've really only learned the basic commands such as CD, LS and 
Nano but I will make a brief not of what they do here. cd = change 
directory ls = list files and folders nano = a text editor within Unix / 
Linux which is commonly used to edit files like commit messages, markdown files, config files etc


Now I'm going to add some text to this file in the browser and see if I can sync it with Git Locally
